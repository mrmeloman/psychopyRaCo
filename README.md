Automatic conditions file selection with self-balancing random procedure for PsychoPy

## Installation:
### For balanced random:
1. Place the `problems_randomisation.csv` file in the `assets` subfolder of your PsyhoPy project
2. Edit the `problems_randomisation.csv` file so it has the names of your condition files
3. Make sure that there's a `,1` in each line after a conditions file name
4. Open your PsychoPy project in PsychoPy
5. Add the "Code" component in the first routine and open it
6. Paste the code from `before_experiment.py` file into the `Before experiment` tab
7. Click `Ok` and save the project
8. I would be happy if you cite this repository in your paper
